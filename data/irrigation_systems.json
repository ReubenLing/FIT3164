        "description": "Furrow irrigation is conducted by creating small parallel channels along the field length in the direction of predominant slope. Water is applied to the top end of each furrow and flows down the field under the influence of gravity. Water may be supplied using gated pipe, siphon and head ditch, or bankless systems. The speed of water movement is determined by many factors such as slope, surface roughness and furrow shape but most importantly by the inflow rate and soil infiltration rate.",

This type of irrigation distributes water via open irrigation channels to irrigation ‘bays’ which are defined by small earthen ‘check banks’. Border check irrigation can be efficient on suitable soils, with appropriate layout and good management. Efficient irrigation is applying the water required by the pasture/crop for optimal growth with a minimum of water lost through deep drainage beyond the roots or excess surface runoff.",
